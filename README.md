# ai-collection

This project was created due to a course called "Learning algorithms in Artificial Intelligence"

The project works as a basis for the algorithms used in that course, which was developed on own hand rather than
going the easy way and use the third party libraries. 


## Self Organized Map

The Self Organized Map is the most usefull algorithm in the repository so far and the 
to my knowledge only well working algorithm at this stage.
The other algorithms are planned to be developed as well


## Challenges for future

 - Adding Parralization for the algorithms
 - Adding the missing Algorithms
    - Restricted Boltzman Machine
    - Shallow Neural Network
    - Convolutional Neural Network
    - Q-Learning
    - Other Reward based algorithms
